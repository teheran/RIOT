@brief       Support for the nRF52840-MDK-Dongle

### General information

The Makerdiary [nRF52840-MDK-Dongle](https://github.com/makerdiary/nrf52840-mdk-usb-dongle/) alike Nordic's original dongle @ref boards_nrf52840-dongle
but with a little different pinout and without dedicated reset button.

The nRF52840-MDK-Dongle is a bare USB-stick shaped device that houses barely
anything than the nRF52840 itself, which offers BLE and 802.15.4 and USB
connectivity.

Unlike similar sticks (like the @ref boards_nrf52840-mdk), it features no
dedicated programmer hardware but relies on direct USB communication with a
built-in bootloader.

The board features one LED (D6: RGB), a user\reset (SW1) button as well as 15 external pins.

### Flash the board

The board is flashed using its on-board boot loader; the
[nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil) program needs to
be installed. That can turn the binary into a suitable zip file and send it to the
bootloader.

The process is automated in the usual `make flash` target. For that process to
complete, you need to enter the bootloader manually. While holding the dongle's 
RESET/USR button, connect it to your host. Readiness of the bootloader is indicated 
by D6 pulsing in red.

### Accessing STDIO

This board has no UART connected via any hardware or programmer USB-UART;
terminal functionality can only be obtained using USBUS once
[#11085](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/11085) is merged.

In the mean time, pins 0.13 and 0.15 are configured as RX and TX on a serial
console.
